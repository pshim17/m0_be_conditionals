    - It is useful for making decisions based on specific conditions. It allows the program to respond differently to different situations.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - I would thoroughly read the lesson and code along during the lectures. I would like to be able to explain the code better with more practice
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - After re-reading notes for the lesson and practicing. I was able to solve the problems and ran into few roadblocks.
